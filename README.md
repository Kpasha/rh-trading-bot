# RobinHood Crypto Trading Bot
A simple Python crypto algotrader 

## Introduction
I've been wanting to play around with algotraders for a while now. After some initial research, I stumbled upon [Jason Bowling's article](https://medium.com/swlh/a-full-crypto-trading-bot-in-python-aafba122bc4e), in which he describes the mechanics of his rudimentary Python bot. His code tickled my curiosity, so I started tinkering with it. In the spirit of open source, I created this public repository to share my experiments with anyone interested in such esoteric stuff.

## Disclaimer
To use Jason's words: cryptocurrency investing is *risky*! Doing it using a computer program is even riskier. Doing it with code you didn’t write is a _terrible_ idea. What you do with this code is entirely up to you, and any risks you take are your own. It’s intended to be educational and comes with absolutely no guarantee of anything at all. You could lose all your money. Seriously.
